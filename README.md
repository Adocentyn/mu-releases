mu/mu4e 0.9.16 is here, and it is our latest stable release!

# Better behaviour and context handling
- Context Handling just got smart:  new ‘mu4e-context’ defines and switches between various contexts, which are groups of settings. This may be used for instance to easily configure and switch between multiple accounts.
- Improved behaviour in html and messages marks: ability to toggle between html and text display of messages & better management of messages marked as read or unread. 

# User Interface improvements
- Numerous improvements in threads view and mailing lists management
- Fancy characters can now be properly used as well as special customizations for message views

# Faster Indexing and message management
- Indexing & caching optimizations

You can grab the tarball directly
[from Github](https://github.com/djcb/mu-releases) or wait a bit to
get it through your distribution channels (details may vary from one
distribution to another).

None of this would be possible without a team of dedicated
individuals: Adam Sampson, Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason, Bar Shirtcliff,
Charles-H. Schulz, Clément Pit--Claudel, Damien Cassou, Declan Qian,
Dima Kogan, Dirk-Jan C. Binnema, Foivos, Foivos S. Zakkak, Hinrik
Örn Sigurðsson, jeroen tiebout, JJ Asghar, Jonas Bernoulli, Jun Hao,
Martin Yrjölä, Maximilian Matthé, Piotr Trojanek, prsarv, Thierry
Volpiatto, Titus von der Malsburg (and of course all people who reported issues,
provided suggestions etc.)

We hope you will enjoy this release as much as we do. Happy Hacking!
                        
                        The mu/mu4e Team
